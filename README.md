# record_linkage
An assignment from Computer Science with Applications II where I linked data take from Yelp and Fodors, two different restaurant review sites. The program that I wrote is in the file record_linkage.py. A helper function was provided by my course instructor (Matthew Wachs) in util.py. My course instructors also provided the data csv files. 

The program links records from Yelps and Fodors that are likely to contain the same restaurant. This is done by calculating Jaro-Winkler distance between of the restaurant names and addresss across the two data sources. Each pair of records that is a potential match is scored and compared to the scores found from a set of known matches. Based on the likelihood of getting the calculated score given that the pair is truly a match, the program decides whether or not to link the records.
